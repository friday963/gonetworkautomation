# Example Scrapli code
## High level objectives
1. Demonstrate the ability to consume input from an external source.
2. Iterate over individual commands from the external source or use it to point to another remote source.  In this example, the pre-maintenance steps were in the input file but the configuration file was a separate entity.  Either way would have worked, but I wanted to demonstrate multiple ways of doing the same thing.
